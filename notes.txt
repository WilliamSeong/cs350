Review
RPC: Remote procedure Call
	Core building block of all distributed systems
	General concept, not specific to Go.
	Provides the abstraction of calling a remote function.
		Serializes the data before sending to a remote process (Data marshaling)
			Would still need serializing even if the process was on the same machine
				Because they have different locations in memory, so data marshaling is still required
			If threads belong to the same process, you can just pass the pointer, so no need for data marshaling

Go Routine: 
	Lightweight thread managed by Go runtime

Go Channel:
	It’s a go feature that allows Go routines to communicate

Go Mutex:
	Mutual Exclusion
	It’s a lock, not specific to Go, general concept
	A way to synchronize threads (Go Routines)
	When you have threads that need to access the same data at the same time, you should protect your data with mutex (for writing)
		Not needed for reading data, that will degrade performance

Deadlock: 
	Two or more threads wait for each other to release a lock
	Indication of deadlock: Program is stalling and there is no cpu utilization, kill program or it will stay like that forever

Time
Why is time useful?
	Can help us track the order of evens in parallel or distributed execution.
		For debugging, troubleshooting, optimizing. Helps reason causality of events, how events interact with each other

How to track time?
	Call time package

Package main

Import (“time” 
		“fmt”)

func main() {
	localTime = time.Now()

	fmt.Printf(“%s\n”, localTime)
}

Possible template:

func main() {
	print_time(1)
	print_time(2)
}

func print_time(id int) { 	localTime = time.Now()
	fmt.Printf(“Timestamp %d: %s\n”, id, localTime)
}

What about concurrent programs?
func main() {
	go print_time(1)
	go print_time(2)
}

func print_time(id int) { 	localTime = time.Now()
	fmt.Printf(“Timestamp %d: %s\n”, id, localTime)
}
These are go routines, Whenever you execute concurrent go routines, there’s no guarantee of the order of execution. So time 1 and time 2 could happened in different orders every time.

What about distributed programs?

Machine A:
func print_time(id int) { 	localTime = time.Now()
	fmt.Printf(“Go routine %d: %s\n”, id, localTime)
}
Output: 2023-01-29 15:40:59.08

Machine B:
func print_time(id int) { 	localTime = time.Now()
	fmt.Printf(“Go routine %d: %s\n”, id, localTime)
}
Output: 2023-01-29 15:40:59.09

Can we figure out the order of these machines using these functions? Which function executed first in real time? Who accessed the clock first?

We can’t say anything about the order because machines have different clocks, and we can’t sync those clocks ever. There is no centralized clock. No global time every process can agree on.

The Clock
Each process pi has an associated clock Ci.
Ci is modele as a function from real times to clock times
Real time is defined by some time standard, such as UTC
The unit of time in UTC is the SI second

Clocks Ci and Cj are delta-synchronized if the difference between the clocks is less or equal to delta.
So a perfect clock system would be 0-synchronized (Impossible)
We can only have loosely synchronized clocks: as closely synchronized as possible (no guarantee)
Clock counters in machines can be arbitrarily out of sync

Why is syncing impossible?
	Temperature variation
	Hardware imperfection
	Network delays
	etc.

Clock Skew
	Difference between two clocks
	Ideally Ci - Cj = 0

Clock drift
	Drift is the accumulated effect of a clock rate that deviated from real time
	Clocks tick at different rates

There is no notion of distributed time in a distributed environment.

How to achieve loosely synchronized clocks?

Network Time Protocol (NTP)
	NTP uses atomic clock as reference to allow machines in. A network synchronize their clocks
	Uses GPS antenna to connect to atomic clock

	NTP achieves an accuracy in the range of 10 microseconds - 10 milliseconds depending on the network

	Some other clocks synchonization protocols can achieve better accuracies but require special HW
	New research to bring the delta down to 10 - 100 nanoseconds without relying on hardware.

Logical Clocks
	If a occurs before b on the same thread/process then a ->r b
	If a is a send(m) and b the receive(m), where m is a message then a ->r b
	a ->r b is transitive, ie, if a ->r b and b ->r c then a ->r c.
	Two events a and b are concurrent (a || b) if not a ->r b and not b ->r a
	Do exercises on slides, remember if both relations can be ruled as no

Casual order, happened-before
How to locally tell if two events are causally related?

Causally is all that matters!



1/31/24 - Lab 2

Parallelism vs Concurrent
	Concurrency is the illusion of concurrency via interleaving, single core
	Parallelism is when they actually run at the same time, multi core

Parallelism uses Machines or cores
And concurrency uses threads and goroutines

main() {
	go hello()
	hello()
}

This will only print hello once since the process ends when the goroutine finishes and the goroutine can finish so quickly so that the normal function call doesn’t get to complete.

main() { 	go hello()
	hello()
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}

This will print two hellos as it will make sure to keep the process up for enough time for the hello function to complete

Channel
	Channels are typed conduit
	Allows for synchronization as it allows goroutines to communicate with each other
	Unbuffered channels: goroutine A will go to the channel to send data, but goroutine B isn’t at the channel yet, so goroutine A will wait.
	Buffered channels: goroutine A will go to the channel and drop the data in the channel even if goroutine B isn’t there. The buffer can hold some number of datum so if the buffer is full, then goroutine A has to wait, similarly to an unbuffered channel, until goroutine B empties the buffer.

	Channels are instantiated using Make().
		ch := make(chan int) default unbuffered channel
		ch := make(chan int, 10) buffered channel with a capacity of 10


	time.Ticker is a way to synchronize using channels
	func heartbeatTicker(d time.Duration) chan struct{} {
		ch := make(chan struct{})
		go func() {
			for {
				time.Sleep(d)
				ch <- struc{}{}
			}
		}()
		return ch
	}
		

	A sender can close a channel to signal that there will be no more data sent through the channel
		func doStuff(ch chan int) {
			close(ch)
		}

	Receivers can test if the channel is closed
		value, ok := <- ch
	func main() { 		ch := make(chan int, 10)
		go doStuff(ch)
		for I := range ch {
			fmt.Println(i)
		}
	}
	i will receive values from the channel repeatedly until the channel is closed.

	Select
		select allows goroutines to wait on multiple communication operations
		select blocks until on of the cases can run, then it executes that case. If there are multiple cases that are ready to that it will choose on at random

		func process(data chan [] byte, command chan int) {
			for {
				select {	
				case d := <- data: // If whatever is in channel data is equal to d, then print the following 
						fmt.Println(“Received data:”, d)
				case cmd := <- command: // If whatever is in channel command is equal to cmd, then print the following
						fmt.Println(“Received command:”, cmd)
						return
				}
			}
		}
		
		in this case the fmt.Println() goroutine is waiting on the results of multiple channels, meaning that it can communicate with the many goroutines that are utilizing those channels.

	Default select case
		Much like a switch statement, the default select case comes when no other case is ready
		
		func latestTimeTicker(d time.Duration) chan time.Time {
			ch := make(chan time.Time, 1) // 1-element time buffer
			go func() { 				for {
					time.Sleep(d)
					select {
					case ch <- time.Now():
					default: // Drop ticks if the reader falls behind
					}
				}
			}()
			return ch
		}

Mutexes
	Goroutines communicate with each other by sending things through channels
	There are other ways to communicate of course.

	What if two goroutines have access to the same data, and they try to access that data at the same time?

	A race condition is when two or more goroutines can access shared data and try to write it at the same time. You don’t know which goroutine will execute first, and so which one will write first
		Both racing to change/access the data

		x := 10
		y := x
		y = y + 1
		x = y

	x := 10
	for i := 0; i < 10,000; i++ {
		go func() {
			y := x
			y = y + 1
			x = y
		}
	}
	If a bunch of these are happening at the same time, it’s possible that you could miss out on some +1s.
	
		x := 10

		mutex.Lock()
		
		y := x
		y = y + 1
		x = y

		mutex.Lock()


		x := 10
		lock := sync.Mutex{}
		for i := 0; i < 10,000; i++ {
			go func() {
				lock.Lock()
				y := x
				y = y + 1
				x = y
				lock.Unlock()
			}
		}

When you have a goroutine in a for loop, ever single call in the for loop will call at the same time*

Assignment 1:
	20 lines of code
	Building block #1: How to create a channel
		Need a tunnel to put the incoming request
	Building block #2: How to spawn k concurrent Go Routines
		For loop, contact k weather stations
	Building block #k: How to allow Go routines to push to the channel
		k go routines that are pushing to the channel
	Building block #k+1: How to pull from the channel every Average Period seconds
		Someone needs to pull from the channel
		1 go routine that is pulling from the channel, to unblock it

Debugging tips: 	Code sometimes returns a wrong average temperature
		Approach:
			Instrument your code so that it prints what each Go routine returns for each batch
				Find a batch where the problem occurs and think why some temperature values are missing
				Make sure you spawn the necessary Go routines
				Make sure each Go routine pushes to the channel
				Make sure you read all values returned
	Go complains that I pass and invalid value to the tick function
		Approach:
			Print the value you pass to the tick function to see what it looks like
				Review the tick function documentation to see what are the expected arguments and their types
				Search for examples online
				Try out some simple examples yourself to make sure you understand how tick works
				Don’t use tick function unless you know how it works

	Program gets stuck
		Approach: Instrument the code to see where exactly it gets stuck
			Think about why the main Go routine may get stuck — what is it waiting for? Has it entered an eternal loop? Is there a deadlock?
	
	If you don’t know how to push and pull into the channel, make another file and create a channel and spawn a goroutine to push into the channel and another to pull from the channel, and play around with it.

Review
Why is time useful?
	Help keep track of the order of events in parallel or distributed execution
	Tracking event order helps us reason about potential causality between events
	Causality of events Is useful in understanding system behavior, debugging, troubleshooting, optimizing, etc.

func main() {
	go print_time(1)
	go print_time(2)
}

func print_time(id int) { 	localTime = time.Now()
	fmt.Printf(“Timestamp %d: %s\n”, id, localTime)
}

There is no guarantee of the order these goroutines will be executed by the go runtime, unless you explicitly have some synchonization in your program.

Machine A:
func print_time(id int) { 	localTime = time.Now()
	fmt.Printf(“Go routine %d: %s\n”, id, localTime)
}
Output: 2023-01-29 15:40:59.08

Machine B:
func print_time(id int) { 	localTime = time.Now()
	fmt.Printf(“Go routine %d: %s\n”, id, localTime)
}
Output: 2023-01-29 15:40:59.09

Local clocks are never synchronized, there may be skew

THERE IS NO GLOBAL TIME

Logical TimeU
Let t be a function from events to a totally ordered set such that for events a, b: If a b then t(a) < t(b)

If you can’t determine if one happened before the order, then you can say that they are concurrent, even if they aren’t

Causal Order
How to locally tell if two events are causally related?
	What information do we need to maintain for each event?
		Store some metadata.
			What does this meta data look like, and how is it created and stored in a distributed system?

Lamport Clocks
	Each process has a logical clock, kept in variable tp (initially tp = 0)
	Process p piggybacks (tp,p) on every message sent

	On internal event a: tp := tp + 1
	On event “send m”: tp := tp + 1 and send(m, (tp, p))
	On even “receive	m” with timestamp (tq, q) from process q: tp := max(tp, tq) + 1 and receive(m,(tp, p))

Comparing Timestamps
The timestamp (tp, p) is unique
Comparing two timestamps(tp, p) and (tq, q)
	(tp, p) < (tq, q) if and only if
		tp <tq or
		tp = tq and p < q

For events a and b on the same process p, tp is strictly increasing, so if a Is before b, then t(a) < t(b)
For events a and b where a is “send(m)” and b is “receive” t(b) is at least t(a) + 1
Transitivity of t(a) < t(b) < t(c) implies transitivity

Lamppost clocks guarantee:
	If a ->r b, then t(a) < t(b)
	If t(a) >= t(b), then a !->r b
		These are one way conditions
	t(a) means local clock of a*

Limitations of Lamport Clocks the happened-before relations a partial order
Lamport clocks define a total order
Information about (non-)causality is lost
We cannot tell by looking at the timestamps of event a and b whether there is a potential causal relation between them, or they are concurrent

Non causality
Two events are concurrent, (no causal relation), if both conditions hold:
	a did not happen before b
	b did not happen before a
Non causality is when two events are concurrent, so we can assume that they affected each other

Vector Clock
Vector clocks address some limitations of Lamport clocks 
The vector clock for an event a is defined as:
	v(a) = (x1, …, xn), where x1 is the number of events at process pi that happened before a

Process p1, …, pn
	Each process pi has local vector v of size n (number of processes)
	v[I].= 0 for all I in [1, n]
	piggy back v on every sent message
	for each transition (on each event) update local v at pi
		v[I] := v[I] + 1 (internal event, send or receive
		v[j] := max(v[j], vq[j]), for all j != I (receive), where vq is the vector clock received from process q

Comparing vector timestamps
Vp <= vq if and only if:
	vp[I] <= vq[I] for all I
Vp < vq if and only if:
	vp <= vq and, there exist some I such that vp[I] < vq[I]
vp||vq if and only if both conditions hold:
	Not vp <vq
	Not vq < vp

Partial and Total Order
Partial order; We have a bunch of elements and some are incomparable, we cannot put them in order
The happened-before relation ->r defines a partial order (concurrent events are not ordered)
The relation < on Lamppost clocks defines a total order (any two distinct clock values are ordered)
The relation < on Vector timestamps defines a partial order (concurrent events are not ordered)
